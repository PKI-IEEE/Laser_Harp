# Laser_Harp

This project consists of eight laser diodes that are aimed at eight photo-resistors in a frame. When one of the laser beams is broken, a microcontroller will output a note/tone to a speaker. The frequency of that note is dependent on which beam was broken. Together these eight laser beams form an octave and the harp can be played as an instrument.
